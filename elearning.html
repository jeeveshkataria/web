        <h1> What is eLearning?</h1>
        <p>Understanding eLearning is simple. eLearning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom.  In most cases, it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online</p>
        <p>There are many terms used to describe learning that is delivered online, via the internet, ranging from Distance Education, to computerized electronic learning, online learning, internet learning and many others. We define eLearning as courses that are specifically delivered via the internet to somewhere other than the classroom where the professor is teaching. It is not a course delivered via a DVD or CD-ROM, video tape or over a television channel. It is interactive in that you can also communicate with your teachers, professors or other students in your class. Sometimes it is delivered live, where you can “electronically” raise your hand and interact in real time and sometimes it is a lecture that has been prerecorded. There is always a teacher or professor interacting /communicating with you and grading your participation, your assignments and your tests. eLearning has been proven to be a successful method of training and education is becoming a way of life for many citizens in North Carolina.</p>

            <h3> Disadvantages of E-learning</h3>
            <p>Well, there are not many disadvantages of eLearning, the main one being that you get knowledge only on a theoretical basis and when it comes to putting to use whatever you have learnt, it may be a little different. The face-to-face learning experience is missing, which may matter to some of you</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Most of the online assessments are limited to questions that are only objective in nature.</li>
                <li>There is also the problem of the extent of security of online learning programs.</li>
                <li>The authenticity of a particular student's work is also a problem as online just about anyone can do a project rather than the actual student itself.</li>
                <li>The assessments that are computer marked generally have a tendency of being only knowledge-based and not necessarily practicality-based.</li>
